# Introduction

I chose Next.js to be the framework for my website because it is the most popular framework for React.
The next reason of choosing Next.js is that it has a way shorter built time. Unlike Gatsbyjs, it takes 1 to 5 minutes for any changes to takes effect depending on the size of the website.
Let's say we have 20 blog pages, then the build time will be about 10 minutes or even more.
With Next.js, it will be only 1 or 2 minutes.

# Chakra UI

Back while developing my first personal website, I decorate the entire website from scratch.
At the beginning, it started easy. Once the number of components increased, maintaining its styling became a challenge.
Thus, I need something that is easy to maintain and consistent across the entire website.

That was when I started considering to use ChakraUI because it is ready to use out of the box. Unlike TailWindCSS or Theme UI, it does not require that much configuration.
The only thing that I need is to install and wrap the `<ChakraProvider>` component around all Next.js components.

Moreover, customizing the theme is easy. First, I have to create a file called `theme.tsx`, under `./styles` in the main directory of the project.

```typescript:theme.tsx
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react";

const Theme = extendTheme({
    fonts: {
        body: "Inter, sans-serif",
    },
});

export default Theme;
```

Once the customized theme has been created, the theme should be included in `_app.tsx` file.

```typescript:_app.tsx {3,7}
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import { Theme } from '../styles/theme'
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
    return (
        <ChakraProvider theme={Theme}>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ChakraProvider>
    )
}

export default MyApp
```

Simply put, the usage of ChakraUI is pretty straight forward. Thus, it became the choice of my framework.

# MDX

The reason I chose MDX is it allows me incorporate mathematical equations in my website.
Some of my posts, for example the posts in the [Gradient Descent: An Optimization Algorithm](/blog/gradient-descent) series, requires alot of maths to explain.

Besides that, there are still many other features that we can implement. [Click here](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) to see the lists of plugins. 

In my own website, I added:

* [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-github-flavored-markdown-) styling
* Code and syntax highlightings
* Katex for mathematical equations

I did not include that much features because more features translate to longer build time. 

# Firebase

Since I want to keep track the engagement of each post, I chose Firebase as the database.
With Firebase, I can store the number of views of each post. In the future, I plan to keep track the number of likes of each post.

# Vercel

Lastly, I chose Vercel as the hosting platform because it is the most popular hosting platform for Next.js, and it is free for hobby projects.
Most importantly, it's easy to setup and Vercel integrates very well with Github.
